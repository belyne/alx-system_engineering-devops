Design of a Simple Web Infrastructure

In this design, we'll create a simple web infrastructure that meets the specified requirements. Let's go through each component and its role:

Server (8.8.8.8):
A server is a physical or virtual machine that hosts the various components of a web application. It listens for incoming requests from users, processes those requests, and sends back the appropriate responses.

Domain Name (www.foobar.com):
A domain name is a human-readable address that is used to access websites. It provides a more user-friendly way to refer to the server's IP address (8.8.8.8 in this case).

DNS Record (www):
The "www" DNS record is a subdomain that helps users access specific services on a domain. In this case, the DNS record "www.foobar.com" points to the server's IP address (8.8.8.8), allowing users to reach the web application.

Web Server (Nginx):
The web server handles incoming HTTP requests from users and manages the distribution of resources (like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images) to fulfill those requests. It acts as a mediator between the user's browser and the application server.

Application Server:
The application server runs the backend code of the web application. It processes dynamic requests, interacts with the database, performs business logic, and generates responses to be sent back to the web server, which then delivers them to the user.

Application Files (Code Base):
The application files consist of your web application's source code. This code is processed by the application server to handle user requests, generate dynamic content, and provide the desired functionality.

Database (MySQL):
The database stores and manages the application's data. It's where you store and retrieve information like user profiles, posts, comments, etc. The application server communicates with the database to retrieve or update data as needed.

Communication with User's Computer:
The communication between the user's computer and the server is facilitated through the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). The user's browser sends HTTP requests to the server, and the server responds with HTTP responses containing the requested content.

Issues with this Infrastructure:

Single Point of Failure (SPOF):
This infrastructure has a single server, which means that if the server goes down, the entire website will become inaccessible. There's no redundancy to handle failures.

Downtime During Maintenance:
Whenever maintenance is required, such as deploying new code or updates, the web server needs to be restarted. This results in downtime during the maintenance process, causing disruption to users.

Limited Scalability:
As the incoming traffic increases, a single server might not be able to handle the load efficiently. The architecture lacks the ability to scale horizontally to accommodate higher traffic volumes.
