# This script automates the process of setting up a domain name and configuring DNS records.

# Step 1: Get a Domain Name
# In this step, you would manually go to a domain registrar's website and search for an available domain.

# Step 2: Register the Domain
# This step involves registering the chosen domain. Since this is a manual process, it's not automated in the script.

# Step 3: Access DNS Management
# After registering the domain, you'll need to access the DNS management section of the registrar's website.

# Step 4: Add an A Record
# This step adds an A record to point the domain to the server's IP address.

# Define variables
domain="example.tech"        # Replace with your chosen domain name
ip_address="192.168.1.1"     # Replace with your server's actual IP address

# Log into the DNS management section (Manual step)

# Add an A record
echo "Adding A record for $domain..."
# The following command assumes you are using a command-line tool like 'nsupdate' or similar.
# Replace it with the actual command provided by your domain registrar.
nsupdate -v <<END
server <DNS_SERVER_IP>
update add $domain 86400 A $ip_address
send
END

# Step 5: Save Changes
# This step usually involves clicking a "Save" or "Submit" button on the registrar's website.
# Since it's a manual step, it's not automated in the script.

# Step 6: Verify DNS Configuration
# You can use the 'dig' command to verify the DNS configuration.
echo "Verifying DNS configuration..."
dig $domain

# Step 7: Update Project Website URL (Manual step)

echo "Domain name setup complete!"

# Note: Some steps are manual and require interaction with the registrar's website, so they are not automated in this script.
